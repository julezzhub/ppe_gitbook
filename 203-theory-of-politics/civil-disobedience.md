# Civil Disobedience

## Distinction from “other” Lawbreaking

-       Convincing judge that action constituted “CD” can lead to less severe sentence in some jurisdictions \(Scheuerman 2018\) à CD seems different to other forms of law-breaking

-       COHEN: Liberal states should encourage citizens to cultivate independent judgements; state has responsibility to soften predicament of CDs when doing so does not greatly damage other policies

↯      Socrates: justifiable illegal conduct is virtually impossible

↯      Trump: BLM “undermines law and order” \(source: Fox News Interview July 2016\)

#### Conscientiousness

-       Thoughtful moral and political concerns

-       Political act guided by political principles, and not by group- or self-interest

§  Motivated by perception of the societal interests

à extension of the political process

-       Law-breaking with seriousness, sincerity, moral conviction

è  This leads to \(1\) different communication \(**publicity**\) and \(2\) **fidelity to law**

\(1\)    CD is **never secretive**, always committed in public

§  Bedau: There is a wish for communication with govt./society to appeal to the public conscience and ultimately frustrate & change the law itself

§  Can happen before or at time of the disobedience, but \(contrary to Rawls\) might also only be publicised once the law has been disobeyed \(e.g. Thoreau\)

§  Otherwise, publicising intention to breach the law gives authorities the opportunity to abort efforts to communicate \(e.g. releasing animals from research laboratories, white-hats hacking into systems\)

\(2\)    The willingness of the offender to accept legal consequences

§  Bedau: To testify their own sincerity and to show they respect the fundamental ideal of the law

§  Lyons: Not a moral, but a strategic judgement

§  Fidelity to law does not necessarily entail fidelity to the political and legal **status quo**

-       **For CD, law-breaking is solely symbolic**

#### Non-violence

Some say nonviolence is a necessary condition for CD and that it is only then justifiable

-       Originated with spiritual influences \(Gandhi, King\); deeply religious leaders promoted nonviolence both as a means and as an end in itself, entangling nonviolence and CD for many

-       Rawls 1999: “To engage in violent acts likely to injure and to hurt is incompatible with CD”

-       King: “It is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends”

Another strain of thought resists defining CD as necessarily nonviolent

-       Does not deny that nonviolence is preferable to violence

-       Might only mean “violence to others”; what about **violence to self, to property**?

§  COHEN, KING: Violence to property can be tolerated when contributing to CD’s persuasive functions; rather public property

§  BUT: For tactical/strategic reasons, might avoid all violence; damage to property can be conflated with vandalism and criminality

§  ALSO this minimizes even indirect culpability for ex post facto violence

-       HABERMAS: Nonviolence leaves room for e.g. impairing others’ freedom of movement and emotional or psychic pressure

-       There’s a **debate about whether non-violence is a necessary condition for legitimate civil disobedience**

-       Spiritual leaders \(GANDHI, KING\) promoted nonviolence both as a means and as an end in itself – leading to widespread conception that nonviolence and civil disobedience cannot be separated

§  KING: “it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends”

§  GANDHI: Not as pragmatic strategy, but a principle rooted in human fallibility

-       RAWLS and SINGER argue that non-violence is a tactical \(not principled\) matter – violence could obscure the communicative quality of disobedience, and public attention could shift to the violent action and away from the laws or policies under protest

§  BROWNLEE objects to this, arguing that violence can also increase the communicative quality by drawing greater attention to the cause and emphasizing the seriousness and frustration of the protesters \(e.g. violence to property during Boston Tea Party, violence to self during self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia in 2011\)

-       RAZ 1979 points out that non-violent \(legal\) acts sometimes cause more harm to others than violent acts – e.g. a \(legal\) strike by ambulance workers may have more severe consequences than minor acts of vandalism

-       Then, CD might be coercive rather than communicative; majorities are being sabotaged, not deliberatively addressed

-       BROWNLEE 2012 allows that certain forms of limited violence might be compatible with civil disobedience because there can be modest or non-injuring acts of violence that wouldn’t necessarily infringe on the civil liberties of those to whom the act of disobedience is addressed 

-       MAY 2015: Non-violent protests can precipitate violent responses

-       Ethic of responsibility: CDs need to think hard about possible consequences of their actions

-       YET would be unfair to deny activists a fair chance to present their case just b/c opponents prove reckless

**Moral vs. tactical reasons**

-       Rawls, Singer: Non-violence is a tactical, not a principled matter

§  Violence could obscure communicative quality of disobedience; public attention could shift to violent act itself and away from laws or policies under protest

↯      Brownlee: Violence can also increase the communicative quality, drawing greater attention to the cause, emphasising seriousness and frustration

-        E.g. violence to property during Boston Tea Party, violence to self during self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia in 2011

**Adams** **2018: CD communicates two things – \(1\) condemnation of a political practice; \(2\) commitment to the political; it makes clear that this particular act of law-breaking is principled and aimed at improving our shared political condition**

## Characteristics

-        \(Non-\)Coercion

o   Coercive form is objectionable on Rawls’s account as it requires that people operate within the democratic context and only do things they have a right to do

§  Don’t challenge the legitimacy of the entire system

§  Disruptive lawbreaking that paralyzes the state machinery can undermine CD’s communicative role

o   GANDHI, KING endorsed paralysing govt.; disrupt and make things unworkable

-        \(Non-\)Revolutionary

o   Some philosophers counselled caution about revolution b/c it can cause a lot of expense and suffering

o   Thoreau: such Cost-Benefit-Analysis is inappropriate when govt. is actively facilitating an injustice as extreme as slavery

o   Gandhi combined CD with revolutionary action

o   Malcolm X: “There is no such thing as a nonviolent revolution; revolution is bloody, hostile, knows no compromise, overturns and destroys everything that gets in its way”

-        \(In-\)Direct

o   Direct: Breaches the same law that is being protested

o   Indirect: Doesn’t breach the same law, i.e. don’t need to commit treason in order to protest a law against treason

§  Democratic CD argues that some injustices \(e.g. poverty\) can’t target a direct law, so need to be indirect

## Different Forms

-       Succeeding gens. of activists and thinkers tried to improve on their predecessors’ mistakes

-       More recent notions of CD – esp. the democratic variant – represent conceptual and political progress

### Religious-Spiritual

-       Gandhi, King etc.: **CD as device to counter evil**

-       Form of divine witness requiring of practitioners a suitably demanding spiritual comportment

-       Gandhi’s **Satyagraha** is a modified idea sprung from CD, where violence of any kind is ruled out and the quest is for the truth

-       CD as moral – and spiritual – obligation/duty

#### Limitations

-       Spiritual underpinnings raise difficult questions for modern pluralism

-       Implicitly denies that CD can be conducted by those w/o faith \(moral elitism; EPSTEIN 1991\)

o   This does not exemplify love or mutual respect

-       RAWLS: By employing \(controversial\) religious ideas, lawbreaking has limited ability to change attitudes in a pluralistic society

### Liberal

-        Rawls and other liberals \(60s and 70s\) free CD from religious bearings and reconfigure it in accordance with modern pluralism

o   à There exists a plurality of competing moral, ethical, religious ideas and conceptions of the good life à acknowledges limitations of religious justifications

-        **CD as useful corrective to overbearing political majorities that periodically threaten minority rights**

-        **CD as a political act, i.e. activists try to persuade their political and legal equals to bring about changes to law and policy**

-        Distinguishes CD from conscientious objection \(BEDAU 1991\)

o   Conscientious objection: Lawbreaking/noncompliance w/o necessarily motivating others à can be private

o   Civil disobedience: Lawbreaking and persuading others \(political act, thereby public\)

o   **CO: Primary goal - personal handwashing \(due to conscience\)**

o   **CD: Primary goal - political change & public education**

-        Religiously motivated lawbreaking is rather CO than CD

-        Rawls: “CD used with due restraint and sound judgement helps to maintain and strengthen just institutions. By resisting injustice within the limits of fidelity to law, it serves to inhibit departures from justice and to correct them when they occur.”

o   Correcting misunderstandings about pre-existing ideals of justice

o   RAWLS: There can be differences in citizen’s conceptions of justice, provided that these conceptions lead to same political judgements

§  Different premises, but same conclusion; overlapping consensus

-        **Limited scope**: Basic structure \(injustices relating basic civil and political liberties, but not matters of social and economic policy\)

o   If we expanded scope, trust and confidence in common institutions would dissipate as we could break laws whenever we deem them unsatisfactory

-        CD as **reform, but not revolution**

#### Limitations

-       Tends to tether CD to a circumscribed and overly complacent brand of political reformism

o   What about CD as igniting major challenges to influential views of justice or other political and constitutional ideals

o   à narrowing of political horizons

-       Liberal vision focuses on a generally just basic structure \(ideal theory\)

o   Can therefore only be employed where sound ideals of justice already exist

o   Difficult in authoritarian contexts

### Democratic

-        Arendt, Habermas challenge liberalism’s narrow understanding of democracy

o   Make sure that democracy us actively practiced, not just preached

-        **CD to overcome democratic deficits, opening door to extensive political and social reform** **à** maximize meaningful deliberation and participation

o   Can initiate novel view of justice and rights

-        CD represents deep convictions of citizens committed to exposing injustice, constantly keeping political power in check and holding decision-makers accountable

o   E.g. protest against nuclear power and the arms race, where public/parliamentary debate was minimal

-        Rawls: CD happens in a nearly just society, which depends on a democratic conception of society, i.e. doesn’t work in e.g. a monarchy where sovereign is held to govern by divine right

↯      **Multiple counterexamples of CD outside of democracy: Arab Spring**

-       CD can quicken the pace of change, allows groups to accomplish what slow-moving institutions cannot achieve à law often falls behind contemporary needs

-       CD as an infinite process in the development of democracy \(**open-ended republican project**\)

o   Norms change throughout history \(e.g. universal suffrage

-       Never a moral action \(no duty or obligation\), but a **political act**

-       **Greater scope**: Private institutions can be targeted, b/c democratization extends beyond state

o   ZINN: “Poverty” is not represented by specific “poverty laws” which poor can violate

-        Needs to be seen through lens of horizontal social contract – govt. as subordinate to political community, rather than standing above it
